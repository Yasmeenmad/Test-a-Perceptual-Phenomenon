# Udacity Data Analysis Nanodegree Project 5

## Test a Perceptual Phenomenon

### Summary
In this project, We will investigate a classic phenomenon from experimental psychology called the Stroop Effect, And create a hypothesis regarding the outcome of the task. We will then look at some data collected from others who have performed the same task and will compute some statistics describing the results. Finally, We will interpret our results in terms of our hypotheses.

#### Why this Project?
Statistics is a major component of data analysis, it allows us to investigate data and make inferences based on our observations. A foundation in statistics also allows us to be a consumer of analyses that others perform, and allows us to relate to the conclusions others have drawn from their investigations.

#### What will I Learn?
This project will review the basic concepts of statistics, including:

- How to identify components of an experiment.
- How to use descriptive statistics to describe qualities of a sample.
- How to set up a hypothesis test, make inferences from a sample, and draw conclusions based on the results.
